Unmaintained (2022-12-08)
-------------------------

With the release of tox 4, this package is no longer necessary, and so is not being maintained.
You can instead use tox 4â€™s ``-f`` option - see below.

----

Adds the ``--py`` flag to tox to run environments matching a given Python interpreter.

Installation
============

Use **pip**:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install tox-py

Python 3.7 to 3.11 supported.

Only tox 3 is supported.

On tox 4, you can use the new |-f factor option|__ to select environments by Python version:

.. |-f factor option| replace:: ``-f`` factor option
__ https://tox.wiki/en/latest/cli_interface.html#tox-run-select-target-environment(s)

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -f py310

On GitHub Actions, you can use ``-f`` with your matrix python version like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

    jobs:
      tests:
        name: Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}

        strategy:
          matrix:
            python-version:
            - 3.7
            - 3.8
            - 3.9
            - '3.10'
            - '3.11'

        steps:
        - ...

        - name: Run tox targets for ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          run: tox run -f py$(echo ${{ matrix.python-version }} | tr -d .)

Usage
=====

After installation, the plugin will be automatically picked up by ``tox``.
It adds one argument: ``--py``, which takes the version to filter environments against.
The version can be specified either as a ``tox.ini``-style dotless version number, or the special string ``current`` for the version of Python that ``tox`` is running under.

For example, to run all Python 3.9 environments:

.. code-block:: sh

    tox --py 39

Or to run all environments matching the version of Python that ``tox`` is running under:


.. code-block:: sh

    tox --py current

This makes configuring CI really easy: configure your CI to trigger each Python version in parallel, running ``tox --py current``.
